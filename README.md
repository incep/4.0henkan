+ Translate input source code in default language into code in another specified language just by hitting space-key once.

## For example:

If you are planning to write Golang code, which you are unfamiliar with, though you are fluent in Java, just do:

 public static void someMethod {
 <:type space-bar:>
 func someMethod {

and you'll get the desired code.
